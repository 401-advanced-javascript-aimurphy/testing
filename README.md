# LAB - 41 React Native

## Trivia App

### Author: Ai

Honestly, I can't reall write the following. I am not really turning this in at this point as a sample of my work because it isn't.

I had wanted to do an app involving using siri and text to speech but wasn't able to get that up and running in time, so I wanted to find something I could work with to at least begin to understand and play with how React Native works. 

That is what this is. 

I found a great article while I was reading up on the topic for class, where this guy named Spencer makes a quick and simple app for dad jokes.

[here is the article](https://medium.com/handlebar-labs/how-dad-jokes-helped-me-better-understand-immutable-data-d4256a0d4eea)

and [here is the snack](https://snack.expo.io/B1N7JqT_G) you can play with.

It has been a while since I played with APIs for fun so I pulled out postman and got to work. I set this up to, instead of dad jokes, give you random trivia about random [numbers](http://numbersapi.com/random/year?json). I also played with My friend's [Ron Swanson Quotes API](http://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes) and it works really well together.

I was in the process of making an initial page where you could pick your poison, but did not get to it yet.

I also tinkered a bit with styling and found it's not very much like (as easy as) css. 

I could definitely use more time but this is as far as I got with all what is going on for now ðŸ™‚

So, I didn't get an awesome scratch app put together, but I did learn a but about react native... and I did learn that I need to invest a bit more to do the apps I was hoping to create. I'm not sure they are Expo material.
